Hello, I am Aina. I am a student of Geo-Information Sciences at Wageningen Unversity with background in environmental sciences. I currently live in the Netherlands, but I was born and raised in Barcelona, and I also briefly worked in Portugal, and travelled around europe; Indeed, I enjoy multicultural environments, and learning about different cultures. My goal in life is to make the world a better place, both from a social and an ecologic perspectives. I am passionate about many things, so I have many hobbies. At the moment I am frequently playing music, gardening and dancing swing. All in all, I would say that I love learning, and I have the capacity to find something interesting in almost everything.
When I work in projects, I am very detailed oriented and meticulous. I believe that presentation of the results is key on projects, because in the end, it is what many times will be seen of the project in the end.
