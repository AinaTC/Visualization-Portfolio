__Course name__ 

Geo-information Tools


__Course code__ 

GRS-20806


__Application of the products__ 

Compute route for a Light Rail and it's costs.


__Potential users__ 

 + Companies
 
 + Local governments
 

__Potential users' requirements__ 

Numbers and maps easy to understand.


__Motivation for choice of visualisation type__ 

Thematic map of the spatial cost of a Rail. It is easy to read, and can add written text providing extra information, like the total costs.


__Dataset(s) used__  

 + DEM
 
 + Buildings
 
 + Infrastructure
 
 + Water
 
 + Census
 
 + Landcover
 

__Processing method(s)__

 + Join and relate tables
 
 + Vector and grid buffers
 
 + Generalization of geometry
 
 + Create suitability raster
 
 + Create cost-path and corridors
 
 + Design in ArcGIS
 
 + Compute costs
 

__Tools used for implementation__ 

  + ArcGIS
  
  + Model Builder 
  

__Reflection on result__

The map is quite clear, showing areas with higher cost thicker that tracks with lower costs, and making the Light rail stand over a transparent background, which adds information but does not take over. with areas more expensive being thickest. Nevertheless adding labels for Most Suitable and Less suitable next to the suitability legend would make it better.3 scenarios were plotted due to uncertainties about the real cost, which price is significantly different, but better information about cost would solve the problem. The criteria used to select suitability areas is subjective, and preferred areas could differ applying different criteria. This allows to change suitability according to the user's preferences.

# __Hiking and Camping Route__

__Course name__ 

Advanced GIS for Earth and Environment

__Course code__


__Application of the products__ 

Provide multiple-day hikking routes


__Potential users__ 

  + Tourism-related companies
 
  + Hikkers 


__Potential users' requirements__ 

Easy to interpret


__Visualisation type__ 

While hikking, internet access is not an always an option, therefore, an analogic map fits the purpose best. 

__Dataset(s)__ 

  + DEM

__Processing method(s)__ 

  + DEM derivatives

  + Cost Path and Suitability
  
  
__Tools used__ 

  + ASTER GDEM
  
  + ArcGIS


__Reflection on result__ 

The potential route for hikking is clear. Results could be improved if locations suitable for camping would be bigger (perhaps with a buffer), so they would be more visible. Choice of colours allow to distinguish the different classes in a logical way (red = difficult, green = easy). The path is created to follow the easier route, which wouldn't be prefered by experienced hikkers. Alternative routes based on difficulty could be added.

__Course code__ 


__Application of the products__

Compare interpolation methods and visualize current temperature at country level


__Potential users__

  + Anyone interested in current temperature at any country 

  + GIS Students and Scientists
  
  + Meteorological agencies

__Potential users' requirements__ 

Quickly understand the temperature from the map. Get an overview of the research done.


__Visualisation type__

An interactive website was build because it allows the user to look not only at near-real time data, but also to select the country in which temperature should be visualized. A 2D reference map shows the temperature data, with colours that are related to temperature (blue=cold, red=warm).


__Dataset(s)__ 

  + Open Weather near real time data
  
  + GDAM Administrative boundaries


__Processing method(s)__ 

  + Read temperature data from API
  
  + Select data for chosen location
  
  + Interpolate
  
  + Build Shinny app
  
  + Update data
  
  
__Tools used__ 
  
  + R: owm, gstat
  
  + shinny app
  
  + leaflet
  
  
__Reflection on result__ 

The shiny app is still very slow due to the large computation time of the interpolation, especially when kriging is selected. Nevertheless, it does its function: it shows temperature near real time (15-30 min difference with real time). The selection of method and country is user friendly, nevertheless, it could still be improved, as there is no action button, to click when user wants to apply a change, and the countries are searched by code, it would be more user friendly for the user to be able to write the country name instead.
